# Write a program that asks the user for a length and uses the turtle to draw a square with sides of that length.  

# There should be a function for drawing the square that takes the length of the sides as a parameter.  For example:



def square(sideLength):
      your code


import turtle
win = turtle.Screen()
sq = turtle.Turtle()

def square(sideLength):
    for i in range(4):
        sq.forward(length)
        sq.right(90)
      
length = float(input("Enter a length."))
square(length)
